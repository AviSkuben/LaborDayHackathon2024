# Project Topic: Job board - Getting small businesses seen

# The Purpose of the Project: 

This job board implementation is designed for people interested in local jobs to see jobs posted by local small businesses. 
Our mission is to create equal opportunities for small businesses by connecting them with job seekers, fostering a vibrant, interconnected local economy. 
We aim to design a non-profit inclusive platform to ensure that every small local business has search visibility as well as the big corporations. 

# How this project aligns with the topic INCLUSION & INTERCONNECTIVITY: 


This project is meant to create a more inclusive job market which connects people from their communities to businesses that serve their communities (e.g. making small businesses that donâ€™t have the capital to run a large number job postings on a more traditional forum). 
Our platform enables small businesses to be seen and accessed by a broader audience. 
It aligns with the 2024 Girls Can Code Hackathon Theme of inclusion and interconnectivity, as we bridge the gap between local enterprises and potential employees and investors, creating a more diverse and inclusive job market.

# Future Directions:

Ultimately, we see our platform as a non-profit hub for local small business growth, promoting local economy and community development.
